and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1]

### Added

- Ability to inject columns during runsheet generation

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- Microarray (Agilent 1 Channel) V&V protocol
- Pandera as dependency for better validation tooling

### Changed

- BulkRNASeq runsheet validation enhanced
  - Upgraded from Schema to Pandera
  - Added checks for dataset metadata columns like 'paired_end'
  - Added sanity check for 'read2_path' column optional nature

### Fixed

- [#19](https://github.com/J-81/dp_tools/issues/19)

## [1.1.9]

### Added
- Runsheet generation for methlySeq ISA archives

## [1.1.8]

### Changed
- GLDS API usage now considers the 'OSD' accession ID as the study ID instead of 'GLDS'.  This is consistent with the recent release of the [OSDR](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/)
### Fixed
- Fixes incorrect numeric inferrence for strings (commit: 3b0d953)[https://github.com/J-81/dp_tools/commit/3b0d9537de73363aaa78979b78b3a209c69ccd45]

## [1.1.7]

### Fixed
- Fixes incorrect unit detection for runsheet generation [#14](https://github.com/J-81/dp_tools/issues/14)
## [1.1.6]

### Added
- Stdout logging for scripts, this better explains what is happening during the script

### Fixed
- Missing Microarray technology valid combination and handling of multiple valid combinations
## [1.1.5]

### Fixed
- Staging runsheets failing to extract unit columns 
- V&V crash related to factor columns being inferred as numeric. Now correctly inferring as string values.

## [1.1.4]
### Added
- Integrity check for gzipped files to bulkRNASeq checks and protocol

### Changed
- Pinned Pandas version to 1.4.4 (prior: no pin, most recent version installed)
  - Version 1.5 causes changes to checksum for pandas objects and would require updating all tests that include a checksum (planned for future)
## [1.1.3]

### Fixed
- Fixing false V&V halt flagging: Add in micro sign as whitelisted (better in sync with r make.names function)
- Expected location of SampleTable.csv and ERCC_SampleTable.csv in 
## [1.1.2]

### Fixed
- Fixing false V&V halt flagging: Add in greek characters as whitelisted (better in sync with r make.names function)

## [1.1.1]
### Fixed
- Incorrect detection of has_ERCC from ISA Archives
  - Example Impacted GLDS: 161,162,163,173
- Runsheet generation failing for different variations of raw reads data column names
  - Example Impacted GLDS: 105,138

## 1.1.0

### First Production Release
- Prior 1.0.0 tagged versions were actually develop style releases
- Moving ahead only production releases will have tags without 'rc' (release candidate) in the name

### Quality Updates
- Various flag messages improved
- Documentation updated

### Added
- Check related to multiQC samples inclusion

## 1.0.8rc

### Changed

- Updated GeneLab filename to url mapping to utilize the [GeneLab public API](https://genelab.nasa.gov/genelabAPIs)
  - Addresses removal of prior-used deprecated endpoints

## 1.0.7rc

### Dockerfile

- Added samtools as needed for certain checks

### Checks

#### Fixed

- check_contrasts_table_rows: message no longer introduces extra newlines into log

## Planned

## rc1.0.6

### Added

#### BulkRNASeq V&V Reporting

- A validation protocol that runs on a BulkRNASeq dataset model
- Includes generation of report files

#### BulkRNASeq Data Model From Nextflow RNASeq Concensus Pipeline

- A set of multi-stage loaders to create a data model
- Includes: validation system and multiQC powered data extraction

### Fixed

- Tilde characters are not converted to periods in contrasts: https://tower.nf/orgs/GL_Testing_Nextflow/workspaces/Nextflow_RCP_Testing/watch/1t8TfGbpDmCVNK
  - this should emulate R make.names behaviour completely

#### BulkRNASeq Reporter File Generation

- Data assets tagged with file categories for reporter file export including:
  - md5sum table
  - curation tables [GeneLab internal use]
